## About
> The initialy started back in 2022 with no Knowledge in Java and even object oriented programming was something i didn't knew about. We reworked the Architecture and Code many Times, still it's not nearly perfect. In August 2025 we went open source with this project, maybe people will collaborate.

## TODO
- Add [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/)
- Use [Clean-Code-Architecture](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-clean-architecture)

## Guidelines
1. The code may only be used for the "Void Roleplay" project (see [License](License.md)).
2. Follow Java conventions and keep code readable.
3. Document new features and changes in the PR description.
